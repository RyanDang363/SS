# RAGGERS data contracts (Stage 0-lite)

This document describes the **shared foundation** every RAGGERS module agrees
on. It is intentionally minimal: each downstream module (transcription, frame
extraction, OCR, captions, chunking, embeddings, retrieval, answers) will add
its own schema as it is built.

## What is Stage 0-lite?

Stage 0-lite is the bare minimum needed for the team to collaborate without
stepping on each other:

- A package layout (`video_rag/`) and an artifact folder layout (`data/`).
- JSON / JSONL read/write helpers with Pydantic validation.
- Two starter schemas:
  - `VideoManifest` — registers a source video.
  - `MediaMetadata` — probed media facts for that video.
- A `python -m video_rag.validate` CLI for smoke-checking artifacts.

> Naming note: the project / demo is **RAGGERS**. The Python package is
> deliberately named `video_rag` so imports stay neutral
> (`from video_rag.schemas import VideoManifest`) while branding lives in the
> README and docs.

No transcription, no frames, no OCR, no embeddings, no retrieval — those come
later, each behind their own schema.

## Why bother with contracts?

Different teammates will write different stages. If we don't agree on field
names and types up front, every consumer ends up writing one-off adapters and
the data on disk is impossible to reason about. A small, enforced schema keeps
artifacts interchangeable and makes bugs obvious at the boundary instead of
deep inside a module.

## Shared conventions

These rules apply to **every** artifact, current or future:

- **`video_id`**: every record that refers to a video must include it. It's the
  join key across all artifacts.
- **Timestamps are seconds, as `float`.** No milliseconds, no `HH:MM:SS`
  strings, no frame indices in time fields.
- **Time ranges** use `start_time` and `end_time`.
- **Single points in time** use `timestamp`.
- **Artifacts are JSON or JSONL.** Use JSON for one-record files
  (`VideoManifest`, `MediaMetadata`) and JSONL for streams of records
  (transcript segments, frame samples, chunks, ...).
- **File paths are stored as strings, repo-root-relative.** Paths inside
  manifests and other artifacts (e.g. `source_path`, frame paths, chunk
  paths) are written relative to the repository root and use forward slashes
  — e.g. `data/videos/lecture_001.mp4`, never `C:\Users\...` and never
  `./data/...`. Pipeline commands should be run from the repo root, or
  should resolve these paths against an explicitly configured project root.
  This keeps artifacts portable between machines and CI.
- **Schemas stay minimal.** Add the field you need now; do not pre-design the
  full pipeline.

## Current schemas

### `VideoManifest`

A registered source video. One JSON file per video, typically under
`data/manifests/`.

| Field               | Type        | Required | Notes                              |
| ------------------- | ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `video_id`          | `str`       | yes      | Non-empty.                         |
| `title`             | `str`       | yes      | Non-empty, human-readable.         |
| `source_path`       | `str`       | yes      | Non-empty path to the video file.  |
| `original_filename` | `str?`      | no       | Original on-disk filename, if any. |
| `created_at`        | `str?`      | no       | ISO-8601 timestamp string.         |

Example: [`examples/video_manifest.example.json`](../examples/video_manifest.example.json).

### `MediaMetadata`

Probed media-level facts for a video. One JSON file per video, typically
alongside the manifest.

| Field              | Type     | Required | Notes                         |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| `video_id`         | `str`    | yes      | Non-empty; joins to manifest. |
| `duration_seconds` | `float`  | yes      | Strictly greater than 0.      |
| `has_audio`        | `bool`   | yes      |                               |
| `fps`              | `float?` | no       | If present, > 0.              |
| `width`            | `int?`   | no       | If present, > 0.              |
| `height`           | `int?`   | no       | If present, > 0.              |

Example: [`examples/media_metadata.example.json`](../examples/media_metadata.example.json).

### `TranscriptSegment`

One timestamped transcript segment for a video. Stored as JSONL — one
record per line — under `data/transcripts/{video_id}.jsonl`.

| Field        | Type    | Required | Notes                                                  |
| ------------ | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `video_id`   | `str`   | yes      | Non-empty; joins to manifest.                          |
| `start_time` | `float` | yes      | Seconds; `>= 0`.                                       |
| `end_time`   | `float` | yes      | Seconds; `> start_time`.                               |
| `text`       | `str`   | yes      | Non-empty after `strip()`.                             |

File-level rules enforced by `python -m video_rag.validate`:

- All records in a file share the same `video_id`.
- Records are ordered by non-decreasing `start_time`. Small overlaps
  between adjacent segments are permitted because real ASR output
  often produces them.

Example: [`examples/transcript_segment.example.jsonl`](../examples/transcript_segment.example.jsonl).

## Stage 1: Video Registration

**Implemented.** Module: [`video_rag/index/register_video.py`](../video_rag/index/register_video.py).

Input:

- local video path
- optional title
- optional `video_id`

Output:

- registered video file under `data/videos/`
- `VideoManifest` under `data/manifests/{video_id}/video_manifest.json`

`video_id` is sanitized (lowercase, spaces to `_`, only `[a-z0-9_-]` allowed)
and de-duplicated with a numeric suffix when generated from a title or
filename. Modes: `--mode copy` (default) or `--mode symlink`. Existing
artifacts are preserved unless `--overwrite` is passed.

CLI:

```bash
python -m video_rag.index.register_video \
  --video path/to/lecture.mp4 \
  --title "Bayes Lecture" \
  --video-id lecture_001
```

This stage does not inspect codecs, duration, FPS, or audio. Media probing
happens in Stage 2.

## Stage 4: Transcription

**Implemented.** Module: [`video_rag/index/transcribe_audio.py`](../video_rag/index/transcribe_audio.py).

Input:

- audio file at `data/audio/{video_id}.wav` (produced by Stage 3)

Output:

- JSONL of `TranscriptSegment` records at
  `data/transcripts/{video_id}.jsonl`

Transcription is delegated to a provider adapter (see
[`video_rag/index/transcription_providers.py`](../video_rag/index/transcription_providers.py)).
The stage attaches `video_id` to each provider segment, sorts by
`start_time` (stable), validates each record against the schema, and
writes the result atomically (`*.jsonl.tmp` + `os.replace`).

Built-in providers:

- **`mock`** — deterministic, offline. **Tests and smoke checks only** —
  do not run on real artifacts.
- **`openai`** — real provider via OpenAI `whisper-1`. Lazy-imports
  `openai` and reads `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment. Install
  with `pip install -e .[transcribe]`.

CLI:

```bash
python -m video_rag.index.transcribe_audio \
  --video-id lecture_001 \
  --provider openai \
  [--language en] \
  [--overwrite]
```

`--provider` is **required**: there is no default, so a mock transcript
can never be produced by accident. A console-script alias
`raggers-transcribe` is installed.

Existing transcripts are preserved unless `--overwrite` is passed, and
overwrite replaces only the single target file in `data/transcripts/` —
sibling transcripts for other videos are never touched.

## Future modules

Each module adds its own schema in `video_rag/schemas.py` (or a sibling
module) when it lands. Anticipated additions — **not implemented yet** —
include:

- `FrameSample` (point: `timestamp`, `frame_path`).
- `OCRRecord`, `CaptionRecord` keyed by `timestamp`.
- `Chunk`, `Embedding`, retrieval results, answer payloads.

Each module owner defines the contract for their stage. Don't pre-spec them
here.

## Folder layout

The artifact folder layout is documented in [`../data/README.md`](../data/README.md).
Currently implemented stages write to `data/videos/`, `data/manifests/`,
`data/transcripts/`, and `data/validation/`; other folders are placeholders.

## Validating artifacts

```bash
python -m video_rag.validate examples/video_manifest.example.json --type video_manifest
python -m video_rag.validate examples/media_metadata.example.json --type media_metadata
python -m video_rag.validate examples/transcript_segment.example.jsonl --type transcript_segments
```

A console script `raggers-validate` is also installed as an alias.

Exit code `0` means valid; non-zero means the file failed schema validation.
